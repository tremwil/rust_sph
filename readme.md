# How to Build & Run: 
1. Install the Rust programming language by following the instructions at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
   **NOTE**: If you are on Windows, you might need to have Visual Studio (or at least the VS C++ Build Tools) installed already. 

2. Open a command prompt in this folder, and compile+run the code by entering the following command: `cargo run --release`
   **NOTE 1**: If you just installed Rust, make sure `cargo`, `rustc` and `rustup` were added to `PATH`!
   **NOTE 2**: The project is not self contained (`cargo` pulls dependencies from upstream), so you will need an internet connection to build.
